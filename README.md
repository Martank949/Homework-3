This is a taped together password generator. I have not perfected the code and some things like the slide and history are not working but it will do. The generator can include/exclude uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and numbers. You can use the slide bar to adjust the length of your password. The slide bar restricts your password to be in-between 8-48 characters. I figured that a minimum of 8 characters should be just enough to have a safe password. Max amount of chars is 48 because thats pretty big password. All that being said, this password generator is fun and glitchy!
